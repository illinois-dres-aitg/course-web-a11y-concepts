      Welcome to the web accessibility concepts course, this session you will be learning about the importance of keyboard accessibility requirements.

      Keyboard navigation is the bedrock of all software and web accessibility guidelines including the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines that us used as the international standard for web accessibility laws.

      Keyboard support includes being able to both operate a web page using only the keyboard and styling the focus so people can perceive the location on the page with keyboard focus.

      Keyboard support is often misunderstood and ignored in designing online resources, since most designs and design tools focus on the dominate modes of interaction of using a mouse pointer or by touching a screen.

      Many people with disabilities though cannot use mouse or touch devices because they do not have the physical capabilities to move and operate a mouse, or the ability to press their finger on a touch screen.  People with visual impairment find it difficult or often impossible to track the location of the pointer or perceive where to touch on a screen.

      The objectives of this session is to introduce important concepts of keyboard support, which include:

      1. Sequential Tab keyboard navigation in browsers.

      2. Visual focus styling of the content of the page with focus.

      3. The ability to bypass blocks of repetitive content on web pages to get the main content.

      4. Keyboard interaction with menus and custom web widgets.

      5. All functionalities are operable through the keyboard.

      6. W3C Web Content Accessibility Guideline for keyboard accessibility.
